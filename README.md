# Mic CO2

`Mic CO2` is a rust server for collecting and displaying data from [Meter Industrial Company]
CO2 meters.

[Meter Industrial Company]: http://www.meterindco.com.tw/

This is not yet able to work for generic deployments, but it has a lot of the needed parts
for monitoring. A serial client to configure the wifi (PC) mode is planned, and serial captures
for configuring the unit have been performed.
